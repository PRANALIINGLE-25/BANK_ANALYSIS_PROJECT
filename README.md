# BANK_ANALYSIS_PROJECT
Bank Transaction Data Analysis Project
Project Overview: This project involves an in-depth analysis of bank transaction data to enhance customer segmentation and assess loan default risk. The objective was to clean and prepare large datasets, perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build visual dashboards to deliver insights that optimize decision-making and improve banking operations.

Key Steps and Methodologies:

Data Collection & Cleaning:

Collected extensive transaction and customer data.
Applied data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and standardizing formats, to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
Data Analysis:

Utilized SQL for querying and managing large datasets efficiently.
Employed Python for statistical analysis, including correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and trend identification.
Implemented exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, outliers, and key factors affecting customer behavior and loan defaults.
Visualization & Reporting:

Developed interactive dashboards and visual reports using Power BI and Excel to present key findings.
Created visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to illustrate data trends and correlations effectively.
Highlighted customer segmentation, profitability, and risk factors through clear and comprehensive visual stories.
Key Insights & Impact:

Provided actionable insights for better customer segmentation and improved credit risk assessment.
Enabled the bank to optimize their marketing strategies, enhance customer targeting, and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals.
Contributed to more accurate risk predictions and refined customer profiling for strategic business growth.
